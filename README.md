## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a PhD in physics turned Machine Learning Engineer, currently working on creating memorable digital experiences at Chanel.

I am the author of [The Regularization Cookbook](https://www.amazon.com/Regularization-Cookbook-practical-recipes-robustness/dp/1837634084/?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_w=p4tHh&content-id=amzn1.sym.952cfb50-b01e-485f-be6e-00434541418b%3Aamzn1.symc.e5c80209-769f-4ade-a325-2eaec14b8e0e&pf_rd_p=952cfb50-b01e-485f-be6e-00434541418b&pf_rd_r=N5QN4D865FXXZVJ54VNB&pd_rd_wg=j5M2e&pd_rd_r=642874d9-5c4a-4b44-9400-373341cdfc58&ref_=pd_gw_ci_mcx_mr_hp_atf_m). You can also get all the codes in [this repo](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/The-Regularization-Cookbook).

âœ¨ I worked for about a decade deploying ML models at scale for various companies, such as General Electric, Renault, Chanel and L'OrÃ©al. I mostly worked on Computer Vision projects: classification, object detection, segmentation, depth estimation, style transfer, landmark, you name it! I am mostly familiar with deployment on cloud with AWS, but I did some succesful deployments on Azure and on edge.

ðŸ”­ I also do a lot of teaching at university and company trainings about machine learning, and I sometimes do coaching and mentoring.

ðŸ’¬ As a Freelancer, I'm always happy to help and work on new projects, as well as just networking and learning from others. Feel free to reach out!
